# Missing Number

This project is an exercise of Python with a simple objective. It must find the minimum integer number - higher than zero - that is missing in the list given.

### Example:

```Python
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

> 5
```

```Python
array = [1, 2, 4, 6, 2, 1]

> 3
````

```Python
array = [-2, 0, 3, 4]

> 1
```

### P.S.:

This project is still in development. So you can find some errors depending on the list you'll give.
